      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hugh Metcalf_began his career as a volunteer recording various bands and community projects, including work with local session musician Gerard Johnson (Saint Etienne) and a year’s volunteering at Antenna Recording Studios a few years after it was established.</p>
      <p>With a taste for the industry Hugh decided to follow a career path by studying formally for a degree in Music Technology at the University of West London. The course is unique as it combines practicing industry experts as well as leading research academics. During his studies Hugh was described as a ‘dedicated’ student by course leader and industry veteran Pip Williams (The Moody Blues, Shirley Bassey, Nightwish). Hugh went on to Graduate with a first class degree in 2011 and was the only student in his year to receive the ‘Academia Design Award’.</p>
      <p>During his studies Hugh was heavily involved with recording showcase events by various departments within the London collage of music. These included the LCM Fashion show, LCM Big Band and the musical theatre at Questors Theatre. During the same period Hugh was also a tour driver for three piece post punk / gutter pop band ‘Not Cool’ (Sleep all Day records), which was born from the ashes of the Violets (Angular Recording Corporation). He took the opportunity to do location recordings for them and in the summer of 2010 was asked to be their front of house mixer in a performance for Hew Stevens’ Introducing.</p>
      <p>As part of a finial year module, ‘experimental sound’, Hugh produced an interactive kinetic sound installation which was showcased at Kinetica Art Fair 2011 (Europe’s largest art fair dedicated to moving art). The piece produced an experimental composition through the use of ambient sound manipulation.</p>
      <p>After graduating, Hugh carried out work testing for faults in OB vehicles at Broadcast Networks, working through SAV Broadcast Technology (SAV Broadcast Technology was the company of Justin Keeley who now works full time as Broadcast engineer at ITV).</p>
      <p>Industry colleagues recommended Hugh to Global Radio to gain experience in radio broadcasting where he contributed in the preparation of advertisements for Heart, Capitial FM, Choice FM, Classic fM, LBC, XFM and Gold.</p>
      <p>Producing a National Lottery funded educational DVD sparked Hugh’s interest in working in audio for film. He went on to make New Media Videos for artists, including recording live events for Susan Aldworth (GV Art) at the National Portrait Gallery, London and editing footage from the ‘The Body is a Big Place’ into a short promotional video for Helen Pynor (GV Art). Hugh was recently employed to work alongside Olga Danylyuk (Royal Central School for Speech &amp; Drama) in the production ‘Serious Games’ at the Collisions festival. The work involved audio post production for videos and cueing video sequences in a theatre performance.</p>
      <p>Hugh’s recent work on set for the short film ‘Air’, which was premiered at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, lead to 6 months work at Halo Post Production. Here, he was asked by Director Dave Stewart to contribute audio to an episode of the BBC Culture Show on Boxing. His work has since been broadcasted by the BBC.<br />
